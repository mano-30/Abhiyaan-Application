Solution:

   We can use an extended Kalman Filter.
   This algorithm can be used to estimate the following features accurately: position, velocity and angular orientation of the vehicle.
   
   The Extended Kalman Filter algorithm provides us with a way of combining or fusing data from the IMU, GPS, compass, airspeed, barometer
   and other sensors to calculate a more accurate and reliable estimate of our position, velocity and angular orientation using some tuning parameters.
   
   The algorithm estimates these parameters using this strategy:
   
   1. IMU Angular rates obtained from rate gyroscope are integrated to calculate the angular position.
   2. The IMU acceleratiosn in (X,Y,Z) from the accelerometer are converted to acceleration in terms of North,East,Down.
   3. These accelerations are integrated to get the velocities.
   4. Velocities is integrated to get the postitions. 
   5. Estimated gyro and accelerometer noise (EKF_GYRO_NOISE and EKF_ACC_NOISE) are used to estimate the growth in error in the angles, 
      velocities and position calculated using IMU data. Making these parameters larger causes the filters error estimate to grow faster. 
      If no corrections are made using other measurements (eg GPS), this error estimate will continue to grow. 
      These estimated errors are captured in a large matrix.
   6. When a GPS measurement arrives, the filter calculates the difference between the predicted position from 4) and the position from the GPS.
   7. The difference from 6), matrix from 5), and the GPS measurement error specified by EKF_POSNE_NOISE are combined to calculate a correction to each of the filter states. 
   8. Because we have now taken a measurement, the amount of uncertainty in each of the states that have been updated is reduced.
